# Q.1 What’s Constructor And Its Purpose?

Ans: A constructor is a special method of a class or structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type. Whenever an object is created, the constructed is called automatically.

# Q.2 Explain This Keyword and Its Purpose?

Ans: The this keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. The most common use of this keyword is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name (because a class attribute is shadowed by a method or constructor parameter).

# Q.3 What’s Call Apply Bind Method & Difference Between them

Ans: Call/Apply call the function immediately, whereas bind returns a function that, when later executed, will have the correct context set for calling the original function.

# Q.4 Explain OOPS?

Ans: A programming concept that works on the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It allows users to create objects they want and create methods to handle those objects.

# Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

Ans: Abstraction is used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation about the data so that users only see the required information. It is one of the most important and essential features of object-oriented programming. Pre-defined functions are similar to data abstraction.

# Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?

Ans: Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming and describes situations in which something occurs in several different forms. In computer science, it describes the concept that you can access objects of different types through the same interface.

# Q.7 Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?

Ans: Inheritance is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming languages. It is a mechanism where you can to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods.

# Q.8 Whats Encapsulation and Purpose of it?

Ans: Encapsulation is one of the fundamentals of OOP. It refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing unauthorized parties direct access to them.

# Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?

Ans: Classes are a template for created objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are unique to classes. For more examples and explanations, see the Using classes guide.

# Q.10 What’s Super Keyword & What it does?

Ans: The super keyword refer to superclass objects. It is used to call superclass constructor. The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate the confusion between superclasses that have methods with the same name.
