# Q.1 What’s difference between Synchronous and Asynchronous?

Ans:

1. Synchronous = happens at the same time.
2. Asynchronous = doesn't happen at the same time.

# Q.2 What are Web Apis ?

Ans: Application Programming Interfaces are constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.

As a real-world example, think about the electricity supply in your house, apartment, or other dwellings. If you want to use an appliance in your house, you plug it into a plug socketand it works. You don't try to wire it directly into the power supply - to do so would be really inefficient and, if you are not an electrician, difficult and dangerous to attempt.

# Q.3 Explain SetTimeOut and setInterval ?

Ans: The setTimeout() method is used to call a function after a certain period of time. The setInterval() JavaScript method is used to call a function repeatedly at a specified interval of time.

# Q.4 How can you handle Async code in JavaScript ?

Ans: In JavaScript, there are more commonways to work with asynchronous operations: then/catch method chaining and async/await. Both methods can be used to handle promises, which are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) or an asynchronous operation.

# Q.5 What are Callbacks & Callback Hell ?

Ans: Callback Hellis essentially nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure.

# Q.6 What are Promises & Explain Some Three Methods of Promise?

Ans: Promises are useful when you have to handle more than one asynchronous task, one after another.For that, we can use promise chaining. You can perform an operation after a promise is resolved using methods then(), catch() and finally().

# Q.7 What’s async & await Keyword in JavaScript?

Ans: The purpose of async / await is to simplify the syntax necessary to consume promise-based APIs.

# Q.8 Explain Purpose of Try and Catch Block & Why do we need it?

Ans: A try block is the block of code (contains a setof statements) in which exceptions can occur; it's used to enclose the code that might throw an exception. The try block is always followed by a catch block, which handles the exception that occursin the associated try block.

# Q.9 Explain fetch?

Ans: The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request the data from a server. The request can be of any type of API that returns the data in JSON or XML.The fetch() method requires one parameter, the URL to request, and returns a promise.

# Q.10 How do you define an asynchronous function in JavaScript using async/await?

Ans: The async function declaration creates a binding of a new async function to a given name. The await keyword is permitted within the function body, enabling asynchronous, promise-based behaviour to be written in a cleaner style and avoiding the need to explicity configure promise chains
